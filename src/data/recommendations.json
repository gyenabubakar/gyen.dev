He demonstrated strong attention to detail and technical proficiency in utilizing top-of-the-line technologies such as Sveltekit, TailwindCSS, and Firebase.\n\nI definitely recommend Gyen Abubakar to anybody looking for a tech partner that is not just knowledgeable and talented but also communicative and trustworthy.",
